## Background
Due to the high-risk nature of space activities, extensive ground-based verification and evaluation of spacecraft are essential prior to launch to improve mission success rates. However, the development of ground test systems presents considerable challenges, as such systems must simultaneously provide controllable gravity simulation, full-degree-of-freedom motion, and large-scale maneuverability. Existing approaches, including drop towers, air flotation, water flotation, and semi-physical simulation, are unable to fulfill all of these requirements at once.

To address this gap, this project aims to propose a movable-anchor-point cable-driven parallel robot (M-CDPR) for controllable gravity simulation. The system is expected to exhibit excellent dynamic responsiveness, robust obstacle-avoidance capabilities, and high dynamic reconfigurability. This project involves comprehensive research on the design and modeling of the M-CDPR, anchor point reconfiguration methods, and the simulation and control strategies necessary to achieve controllable gravity environments.
